Hi, welcome to our Mass Housing Tool!

We developed these set of tools to help you reduce some of the barriers you might face face in using your 
housing voucher to access rental units in higher opportunity areas.

Our tool has three components:

* “House Locator Tool”: it allows renters to explore new areas and expand their search;

* “Address Locator Tool”: it allows the searchers to look for social and environmental indicators for 
a particular address;

* “Weekly Listings Alert”: it allows the users, by signing up for a newsletter, to receive a tailored list 
of online housing listings in curated areas.

Our goal is to help voucher holders make more informed relocation decisions: better information leads to 
better decisions. If you have any question or comment, reach out to us and we’ll help you!
